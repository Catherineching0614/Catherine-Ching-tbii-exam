#### Catherine-Ching-tbii-exam
This repository contains my Tech Basics II Exam Project code which I have built a MVP for an App to experience vieews from the color blind and to learn more about primary color theories.

When the users run the **app.py**, they would be greeted by a welcome page where they can enter their name. Following by the menu page where on the left, they can choose which type of color bind situation they would like to experience. And on the right, a game to remind you about magenta in the three principal colors and two tools to experience color mixing theory.

In the repository, it also contains the relavent image files, music files and helpers.py for the app to run.

**Recommended to look through the images file as it might bring surprise :shushing_face:**
